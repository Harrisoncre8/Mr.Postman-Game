2D Platformer made with Unity 

## Description
Unity is a game engine that allows users to create and experience games in real-time across many different platforms such as mobile, desktop, consoles, and virtual reality. Games in Unity is primarily scripted with C# and can be, but not limited to 2-dimensional, 3-dimensional, virtual reality, and augmented reality. The Unity game engine has also been used in other industries such as film and automotive.

Unity would enhance a part of our Prime full-stack, by quickly showing our scripting in full-time through the editor. 

My main resource in learning and building comes from this link via LinkedIn Learning:

It's a short course on building a 2D platformer with provided artwork and TileMapEditor.

The most challenging part of this process was time management. The goals and moving parts seemed simple, but took a lot longer than expected to achieve.

With more time, I would customize my project to get it to be closer to my vision. I would add audio as well as create a different tile map for the levels, and write a backstory for the game.
